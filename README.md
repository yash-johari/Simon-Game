# Simon-Game
I created a Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery. It's a classic memory challenge with colored buttons. The game flashes a sequence, and players replicate it. Each success adds a new color. Mistakes end the game, challenging memory and pattern recognition for the longest sequence.
